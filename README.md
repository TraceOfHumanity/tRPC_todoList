This project was created to introduce the tRPC library. It is a web application for notes. The application is very simple and has only a few pages:

1. To view all notes.
2. To create a note.
3. To edit the note.
4. To view a single note.

The project was created using T3.

Technologies used:
 ⁕ tRPC,
 ⁕ TailwindCSS,
 ⁕ Prisma,
 ⁕ MongoDB,
 ⁕ NextJS.
 
If you want to test the application, download it and add the .env file to the root folder of the project. In this file, create a variable DATABASE_URL="" whose value will be a link to your MongoDB database and a variable NODE_ENV="development". After that, write the command npm run start or npm run dev in the terminal.
